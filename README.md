# Data Science Projects

Welcome to our GitHub repository! This is the home of my Data Science projects that I have developed.

## Projects

### Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Social Media
This project focuses on sentiment analysis on Twitter using NLP, categorizing tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Techniques include data cleaning, preprocessing, and using machine learning and deep learning models. The goal is to accurately predict sentiments to gain valuable insights from Twitter users. Though challenging, the project aims to provide meaningful results for brand monitoring, opinion analysis, and decision-making. Despite potential limitations in handling sarcasm or cultural context, the approach remains innovative and promising in understanding social media dynamics

### Diabetes Prediction 
This project focuses on diabetes prediction using machine learning techniques. The objective is to build a model that can accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on relevant features and data. Preprocessing steps are applied to ensure data quality, and various machine learning algorithms are explored and evaluated for their predictive performance. However, challenges may arise due to the complexity of diabetes factors and individual variations in health data, impacting prediction accuracy.

### Housing Prediction
This project aims to predict housing prices using machine learning methods. The main objective is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on relevant features and historical data. Data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the data for analysis. Various machine learning algorithms, such as regression models, are utilized to build predictive models. Feature engineering and selection are performed to improve model performance. The project strives to provide valuable insights into real estate market trends and assist potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions. However, challenges may arise from the complexity of housing market dynamics and external factors impacting property prices.

### Language Detection
This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately identify the language in which a given text is written. This involves employing various natural language processing techniques to analyze and classify text data based on their linguistic features. While the task might seem straightforward, the project acknowledges the complexities arising from the diverse nature of languages, variations in writing styles, and potential linguistic overlaps.

### Text Classification with vnexpress dataset

This project involves classifying a collection of over 40,000 articles from VNexpress into 13 distinct categories using both traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning models. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, preprocessed using text normalization, tokenization, and stopword removal. Data visualizations were generated to explore category distributions. The classification models encompassed Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, ensemble methods (LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest), and deep learning approaches (RNN, LSTM). The primary objective is to assess and compare the accuracy of machine learning versus deep learning in text classification for the vnexpress dataset, shedding light on optimal approaches for this Vietnamese news article corpus. 

### Fake news detection
This project aims to detect fake news on the internet. In this project, I have employed techniques such as removing stopwords and special characters, as well as stemming words. I utilized the TF-IDF method to vectorize the data and employed machine learning techniques for prediction.

### Data ETL pipeline
In my project, I utilize the Keras Fashion MNIST dataset, employing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) approach. I extract data from this dataset, perform necessary transformations, and then store it in an SQLite3 database. This stored data is later loaded for subsequent use within another project.

### Topic Modeling
This project employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling. LDA is a statistical model used to extract meaningful topics from a collection of text data. We also include data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare your text data for analysis.

### Mobile price prediction
The pricing of smartphones is a critical aspect of marketing, as these devices are packed with features, making it essential to strike a balance between justifying the price and covering manufacturing and marketing costs. With mobile phones being highly popular and frequently upgraded, setting the right price is challenging for aspiring mobile phone businesses. This project focuses on classifying mobile prices using machine learning methods. 

### Google search analysis
The statement highlights that Google handles a massive volume of searches daily, making it a valuable source for search query data analysis. While Google doesn't provide direct access to daily search query data, Google Trends offers an API called "pytrends" for this purpose. The project involves analyzing the search term "Machine learning" using this API.

### Time series bicyle counts on Fremont Bridge
As an example of working with some time series data, let's take a look at bicycle counts on Seattle's Fremont Bridge. This data comes from an automated bicycle counter installed in late 2012, which has inductive sensors on the east and west sidewalks of the bridge. In this project, I aim to analyze detailed bicycle counts on the Fremont Bridge.

### Customer segmentation
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed examination of a company's ideal customers, helping the business better understand its customers' unique needs, behaviors, and concerns. This analysis allows the company to tailor its products to specific customer segments, rather than wasting resources on a broad marketing approach. In this project, customer clustering will be performed to provide relevant insights and recommendations.

### SQL Project 
In this project, I will practice working with databases using PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server.

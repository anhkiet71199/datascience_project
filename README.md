# Data Science Projects

Welcome to our GitHub repository! This is the home of my Data Science projects that I have developed.

## Projects

### Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Social Media
This project focuses on sentiment analysis on Twitter using NLP, categorizing tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Techniques include data cleaning, preprocessing, and using machine learning and deep learning models. The goal is to accurately predict sentiments to gain valuable insights from Twitter users. Though challenging, the project aims to provide meaningful results for brand monitoring, opinion analysis, and decision-making. Despite potential limitations in handling sarcasm or cultural context, the approach remains innovative and promising in understanding social media dynamics

### Diabetes Prediction 
This project focuses on diabetes prediction using machine learning techniques. The objective is to build a model that can accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on relevant features and data. Preprocessing steps are applied to ensure data quality, and various machine learning algorithms are explored and evaluated for their predictive performance. However, challenges may arise due to the complexity of diabetes factors and individual variations in health data, impacting prediction accuracy.

### Housing Prediction
This project aims to predict housing prices using machine learning methods. The main objective is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on relevant features and historical data. Data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the data for analysis. Various machine learning algorithms, such as regression models, are utilized to build predictive models. Feature engineering and selection are performed to improve model performance. The project strives to provide valuable insights into real estate market trends and assist potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions. However, challenges may arise from the complexity of housing market dynamics and external factors impacting property prices.

### Langua Detection
This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately identify the language in which a given text is written. This involves employing various natural language processing techniques to analyze and classify text data based on their linguistic features. While the task might seem straightforward, the project acknowledges the complexities arising from the diverse nature of languages, variations in writing styles, and potential linguistic overlaps.
